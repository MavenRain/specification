= Proof Hash Scheme
:cddl: ./cddl/

Each node contains a "kv hash", which is the hash of a prefix concatenanted with the nodes key and its value.
The hash of the node is the hash of a distinct prefix, the kv hash, and the hash of each of the left and right child nodes.

```
kv_hash = H(0x00, key, value)
node_hash = H(0x01, kv_hash, left_child_hash, right_child_hash)
```

The hash function H is currently the blake3 hash.
