== Introduction

The MANY protocol relies on digital signatures of messages to identify users and servers.
Messages are tagged COSE Sign envelopes containing headers and a signature (and optionally counter signatures).

== Identity

The identity of a sender must be resolved with the following algorithm:

1. If the signature is empty and there is no Key ID field in the protected headers, the resolved identity is Anonymous.

2. If there is a signature and a Key ID;

   a. The Key ID of the protected header matches a key in the `"keyset"` protected header.
      If no key fits the Key ID, the server MUST return an error.
   b. Use the key to try and validate the COSE signature.
   c. The resolved identity is the one derived from the public key (see xref:identity.adoc#_cose_key[Identity â€“ COSE Key]]).

3. The resulting key is compared with the message's `from` field:
   a. if the `from` address is anonymous and the resolved key is not, the server MUST return an error.
   b. if the `from` address is a public key and it matches the resolved key, the address is used as the sender.
   c. if the `from` address is a sub-resource identity and its public key matches the resolved key, use the subresource identity address as the sender.

The final resolved address can be used to identify the sender where it makes sense (e.g. resolving ACLs).
