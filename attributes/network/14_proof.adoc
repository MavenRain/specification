= Proof Attribute (#14)
:cddl: ./cddl/

This attribute allows server to deliver the proof of an object requested.
The proof itself is a sequence of actions used to construct the state in which the object is embedded within the corresponding Merkle tree.

== Attribute Argument

This is a uint representing the hasher to be used in constructing proofs.

* 0 - merk hash 

* 1 -

== Hash Scheme

Each node contains a "kv hash", which is the hash of a prefix concatenanted with the nodes key and its value.
The hash of the node is the hash of a distinct prefix, the kv hash, and the hash of each of the left and right child nodes.

```
kv_hash = H(0x00, key, value)
node_hash = H(0x01, kv_hash, left_child_hash, right_child_hash)
```
